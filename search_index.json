All configuration is done via the gateway. It communicates with the Ruuvi Tag using the Nordic UART interface via GATT messages transported by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Most logic regarding acceleration logging is implemented inside the module app_accelerometer_logging.c. Three use cases are shown in this figure. 3.1 Initializing acceleration logging The initialization is shown with blue arrows and numbers in black circles until #4. To activate acceleration logging the gateway sends the message 0xFA 0xFA 0x0A 0x01. In general GATT messages are handled by the function handle_comms() inside the module app_comm.c. Messages regarding acceleration logging are delegated to the function handle_lis2dh12_comms() inside the same module. After receiving the message to activate acceleration logging the function app_enable_sensor_logging() inside the module app_accelerometer_logging.c in called (1). The first step in activation is to check if some conditions are fulfilled. The function returns an error code if acceleration logging is already active or if it is called on a sensor which does not include an LIS2DH12. This check is done by calling find_sensor() inside of app_sensor.c (2). This function returns the sensor context. The sensor context consists of several information about the sensor. The next step associates the function on_fifo_full() from app_accelerometer_logging.c with the interrupt pin retrieved from the sensor context (3). The last step is to activate FIFO and interrupt generation inside the LIS2DH12. This is done by calling two functions from the sensor context. At last the function pointer to data_get() inside the sensor context is replaced by the pointer to the function lis2dh12_logged_data_get(). 3.2 Retrieving data from FIFO When FIFO is full inside LIS2DH12 the interrupt starts the function on_fifo_full(). This function does not directly handle the new data. It schedules a call to fifo_full_handler(). Instead of on_fifo_full() this is called in the main thread of the application. If processing is done inside a function inside an interrupt context this prevents processing of another interrupt. This should be avoided. Inside fifo_full_handler() the FIFO from LIS2DH12 is read (5). The values are store in memory in raw format to be ready to present them to the function lis2dh12_logged_data_get() which is important for heartbeat. In parallel the raw values are compacted by removing all unused bits. This is done by the functions pack8/10/12(). A timestamp is added to the compacted values. These values are handover to the ringbuffer which writes them to flash (6). 3.3 Using the data by hearbeat This use case is shown with magenta arrows and numbers inside magenta circles in the figure above. The heartbeat retrieves the values from all sensors by calling the function app_sensor_get() inside the module app_sensors.c. In the original setup this function calls ri_lis2dh12_data_get() inside ruuvi_interface_lis2dh12.c. During initialization this function is replaced by lis2dh12_logged_data_get(). lis2dh12_logged_data_get() retrieves the raw acceleration values from memory. Then the values are parsed by calling ri_lis2dh12_raw_data_parse() and returned to the heartbeat. 3.4 Initialization during boot All sensor initialization is done inside setup() from main.c. This function calls app_acc_logging_init() inside app_accelerometer_logging.c. The function checks if the ringbuffer exists. If this is true it activates acceleration logging as described earlier. 3.5 Implementation 3.5.1 app_accelerometer_logging.c 3.5.1.1 rd_status_t app_enable_sensor_logging(void) Enables the logging of acceleration data.

RD_ERROR_INVALID_STATE If logging is not active. 3.5.1.9 rd_status_t app_acc_logging_configuration_set (rt_sensor_ctx_t* sensor, rd_sensor_configuration_t* new_config) This function is called when a request to update the sensor configuration is received by GATT/UART. It checks every configuration parameter if it should be changed. It also checks if the value is different than actual value. If a change is detected it clears the ringbuffer, updates the configuration and stores the configuration in flash. Parameters sensor in Sensor context of the sensor which configuration should be changed. new_config in Structure containing the new configuration values. 3.5.1.10 rd_status_t app_acc_logging_init(void) Initialize acceleration logging during boot. If logging was active before reboot it will be activated. If logging was not active before reboot this function return RD_SUCCESS without activating acceleration logging.

It uses the Nordic UART service which itself uses the Bluetooth GATT protocol. Three types of messages are used. The Gateway sends control messages to the sensor to set or read configuration or start transmission of logged data. The Sensor responds to control messages via response messages. This message type transports status information or configuration data. If the Gateway requests the Sensor to send logged data, this data is sent by data messages. To transport all data many data messages are used in sequence. The end of data is signaled by a response message. The messages are differentiated by the first byte. 6.1 Control messages Control messages are indicated by the value 0xFA in the first position. This byte is repeated in the second position. The type of the message is distinguished by the third byte. The general structure of a control message is show in the following table. Header Header Type Parameter 0xFA 0xFA XX Zero or more Parameter Control messages must be padded by nullbytes to a minimum length of 11 bytes. This requirement is introduced by the Ruuvi firmware.

The data is returned in blocks of 32 tuples of x-, y-, z-values. Every block is preceded by the timestamp when the interrupt occured which this block generates. To decode the data block the information about the resolution and the scale is needed. This information is transmitted by the end of data message. All values are transferred in little-endian byte sequence. After de-compacting every value must be interpreted as the most significant part of an 16 bit wide signed integer. To get the real acceleration value from this intermediate value multiply it by one of the following factors. Scale / Resolution 8 bit 10 bit 12 bit 2G \\(\\frac{16}{256*1000}\\) \\(\\frac{4}{64*1000}\\) \\(\\frac{1}{16*1000}\\) 4G \\(\\frac{32}{256*1000}\\) \\(\\frac{8}{64*1000}\\) \\(\\frac{2}{16*1000}\\) 8G \\(\\frac{64}{256*1000}\\) \\(\\frac{16}{64*1000}\\) \\(\\frac{4}{16*1000}\\) 16G \\(\\frac{192}{256*1000}\\) \\(\\frac{48}{64*1000}\\) \\(\\frac{12}{16*1000}\\) 6.3.1 12 bit data format In 12 bit resolution mode two values are transmitted inside 3 bytes. See following figure. 6.3.2 10 bit data format In 10 bit resolution mode four values are transmitted inside 5 bytes. See following figure. 6.3.3 8 bit data format In 8 bit resolution mode every value is transmitted seperatly. See following figure. 6.4 Communication example The following figure shows an example communication.

The most promising candidate is the Macronix MX25R as it supports low power battery driven applications, is quite flexible in terms of required voltage and is also used in some newer Nordic reference designs. 7.1.2 Board Redesign The current sensor board revision features two antennas, while the bluetooth antenna is required and onboard NFC antenna is not used, therefore the board footprint could be smaller. Inspiration for a board revision could be drawn from the discontinued nRF51822 Bluetooth Smart Beacon Kit reference design. 7.2 Software 7.2.1 Implementation ID’s used in GATT messages and for storing the ringbuffer state structure are temporary used. These ID’s must be defined/approved by Ruuvi. 7.2.2 General ToDo Remotely customizing the Heartbeat interval (persistence required) Flexibilizing the Logging Rate so that it can be precisely controlled and the sensor supports rates that the accelerometer does not support natively (e.g. 2 Hz) Adapted Advertisement Message Format: Indicate amount of used internal storage to be used by the gateway to trigger connections and manage dowloading of logged data. 7.2.3 Security Questions: * Can Advertisements be encrypted? * How to manage access for downloading internally stored data and allow for encrypted transportation? "],["gateway-1.html", "Chapter 8 Gateway 8.1 Hardware 8.2 Software", " Chapter 8 Gateway 8.1 Hardware 8.1.1 Uninterruptible Power Supply For operating in remote environments the gateway should be equipped with a Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). This allows tolerating short power outages and should be configurable to user alternative energy sources such as solar panel or wind turbines to allow for autonomous operation. The most promising products are: * PiJuice Hat * Sixfab UPS Power Hat * UPS PIco HV4.0B Advanced Questions: * How to work with unregulated power sources such as cheap/raw solar panels? * Which UPS provides the best software (Free/Open/Functionality/Reliability)? 8.1.2 Camera A camera is required to record a video stream that is used to derive the ground truth for classification tasks. Use cases can be extended to perform analytics based on the captured images or the video stream. 8.1.2.1 RPi Camera The main camera for the gateway will be the original camera module offered by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which provides the benefit of an actively maintained software interface and guaranteed compatibility with the used Single Board Computer (SBC). Additionally it is available in two versions, a normal and a NoIR (Night Vision) Version. Questions: * How to match the video feed with the data that is received via Bluetooth? * Which illumination is required for the NoIR Version? * Is it possible to mechanically align the angles (perfect Video overlay) and use both camera versions simultaneously? 8.1.2.2 Thermal Camera For some use cases it may be reasonable to monitor temperatures via a thermal camera. The thermal camera should be seen as an optional addition to the gateway. Questions: * Which module should be chosen in terms of features (especially resolution and connection) and size? * How to align images from all installed cameras (perfectly aligned video stream)? 8.1.3 3g/4g/5g Module Autonomous operation requires a network connection for control and (at least partial) data transfer. Questions: * Which module can be used solely via the GPIO Header (no USB Cable)? * Which module offers the best software interaface( Free/Open/Functionality/Reliability)? 8.1.4 Bluetooth Hardware Alternating and/or extending the Bluetooth Hardware serves two purposes. Having multiple bluetooth devices should allow for monitoring more sensors simultaneously. Including at least one device with support for external antennas would also allow for increased range.
