# BLE GATT Messages #

Communication between Gateway and Sensor is done via Bluetooth Low Energy. It uses the Nordic UART service which itself uses the Bluetooth GATT protocol. 

At the time of writing this document the Sensor supports two generations of messages. 

1. The first generation was defined in Wintersemester 2020/21. These messages are using header bytes starting at `0xFA`. Messages which use are reserved by Ruuvi for proprietary messages. 
2. Messages from the second generation use header bytes which are defined in the file ruuvi_endpoints.h.

Most use cases can be started by both message type. In the following documentation messages from the second generation are documented where they exist. Generation one messages will be removed from the firmware in some of the next version.

## General message structure ##

The general structure of a message is show in the following table.

| Header | Header | Operation | Parameter |
|-|-|-|-|
| destination | source | XX | Zero or more Parameter |

The first byte *destination* addresses the service which should process the message. The second byte *source* contains the source which originated the message. 

## Control messages ##

Control messages are sent to the sensor. They must be padded by nullbytes to a minimum length of 11 bytes. This requirement is introduced by the Ruuvi firmware. The padding bytes are not shown in the following description of the messages.

### Start transmitting acceleration data ###

This message starts transmitting of acceleration data. It takes one parameter.

It's concrete content is: `0x4A 0x4A 0x11 P1`.

The parameter `P1` controls the source of the data which should be returned.

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
| `0x00` | The last sample of acceleration data should be returned. This sample consists of 32 tuples of (X,Y,Z) values. It is taken from RAM. |
| `0x01` | Logged acceleration data from the ringbuffer should be returned. The data includes the last page which is not complete full and is not yet written to flash.  |

In every case the data is transmitted by using data messages. The transmission of the data is followed by a [end of data message](ble-gatt-messages.html#end-of-data-message) which signals the end of the data. 

If acceleration logging is not active, the Sensor responds a [status response](ble-gatt-messages.html#status-response) containing error code `RD_ERROR_INVALID_STATE`.


### Set configuration of acceleration sensor ###

This message is used to set the configuration of the acceleration sensor (LIS2DH12). The message takes 8 Parameters. The Sensor responds to this message with a [status response](ble-gatt-messages.html#status-response). The parameters are as follows.

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
| P1 | Rate of sampling in smaples per second. Allowed values are 1Hz, 10Hz, 25Hz, 50Hz, 100Hz, 200Hz, 400Hz (use `0xC9`). |
| P2 | Resolution in bits. Allowed values are 8, 10, 12. |
| P3 | Measuring range. Allowed values are 2G, 4G, 8G, 16G. |
| P4 | DSP function. See datasheet of LIS2DH12. |
| P5 | DSP parameter. See datasheet of LIS2DH12. |
| P6 | Mode of operation. Allowed values are `0xF2`, `0xF3`, `0xF4`. See ruuvi_driver_sensor.h for explanation. |
| P7 | Frequency divider. This value is used to only save every P7-th value. |
| P8 | Reserved. Set to `0x00`. |

All values from P1 to P7 can be set to `0xFF` which means 'do not change this values'.

The concrete content of this message is `0x4A 0x4A 0x02 P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P7 P8`.

### Read configuration of acceleration sensor ###

This message is used to read the configuration of the acceleration sensor (LIS2DH12). The message takes no parameters. The Sensor responds to this message by a [response message which transmits the configuration](ble-gatt-messages.html#configuration-response).

The concrete content of this message is: `0x4A 0x4A 0x03`.

### Set system time ###

This message is used to set the RTC of the sensor to a timestamp which is part of the message. The time is expressed in milliseconds. It must be transmitted in [little-endian][endianess] byte sequence. The sensor responds to this message with a [status response](ble-gatt-messages.html#status-response).

The concrete content of this message is `0x21 0x21 0x08 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX`.

### Read system time ###

This message is used to read the RTC of the sensor. The sensor responds to this message with a [timestamp response](ble-gatt-messages.html#timestamp-response).

The concrete content of this message is `0x21 0x21 0x09`.

### Control acceleration logging ###

This message is used to activate or deactivate acceleration logging. It takes one parameter. The parameter is interpreted as a boolean value. If it maps to true, acceleration logging is activated. If it maps to false, acceleration logging is deactivated. The sensor responds to this message using a [status response](ble-gatt-messages.html#status-response). Activating acceleration logging when it is already active results in an error. Deactivating acceleration logging when it is not active results in an error.

The concrete content of this message is `0x4A 0x4A 0x08 XX`. Where `XX` can be `0x00` or `0x01`.

### Query status of acceleration logging ###

This message is used to query the status of acceleration logging. The sensor responds to this message with a [status response](ble-gatt-messages.html#status-response). If logging is active, the response contains the status `RD_SUCCESS` if logging is not active the status is `RD_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED`.

The concrete content of this message is `0x4A 0x4A 0x09`.

## Response messages ##

Every response message returns a status code as the result of the processing as the third byte. It must be interpreted as a bitfield. The bits represent the different error conditions. The following table show the error conditions. In case of mulpilte errors more than one bit can be set. If no bit is set the processing was successful.

| Value | Error |
|-|-|
| status==0 | RD_SUCCESS: No error
| 1         | RD_ERROR_INTERNAL: Internal Error

### Status response ###

This message is used to return a status code to the gateway if no other information is available.

| Header | Header | Operation | Status |
|-|-|-|-|
| destination | source | operation | SS |

Where `SS` is the status code. See above table.

The header bytes *destination* and *source* are the same bytes from the control message but in reversed order. The third byte *operation* is equal to the byte *operation* from the control message which caused this response.

### End of data message ###

This message is sent to the gateway after returning data. It signals the end of the transmission. This message contains nine parameters. The current configuration of the acceleration sensor are the first eight parameter. The structure is the same as shown in the [set configuration message](ble-gatt-messages.html#set-configuration-of-acceleration-sensor). The CRC16 value of the transmitted data is the 9th parameter.

To compute the CRC16 value the polynom `0x11021` with the initial value `0xFFFF` is used. The output bytes are not reversed and not XOR'd. The CRC value is of size 2 bytes. It is transfered in [little-endian][endianess] byte sequence.

The concrete content of this message is `0x4A 0x4A 0x11 SS P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P7 P8 CRC1 CRC2`. 

Where `SS` is the status code. See above table.

### Configuration response ###

This message is sent to the gateway after requesting the current configuration. The message contains eight parameters containing the current configuration. If the status code signals an error the transmitted values is undefined.

The concrete content of this message is `0x4A 0x4A 0x03 SS P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P7 P8`. The values P1 to P8 map to the same values as shown in [set configuration message](ble-gatt-messages.html#set-configuration-of-acceleration-sensor).

Where `SS` is the status code. See above table.

### Timestamp response ###

This message is sent to the gateway after requesting the system time. The message contains one parameter. The parameter is a 8 byte value containing the current timestamp. The bytes are transferred in [little-endian][endianess] sequence. If the status code signals an error the transmitted value is undefined.

The concrete content of this message is `0x21 0x21 0x09 SS XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX`. Where `SS` is the status code. 

## Data message ##

Data messages are used to transfer logged acceleration data. A data message starts with the byte `0x11`. After the start byte there follows up to 19 bytes of data.

The concrete content of this message is `0x11 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX`. 

The data is returned in blocks of 32 tuples of x-, y-, z-values. Every block is preceded by the timestamp when the interrupt occured which this block generates. To decode the data block the information about the resolution and the scale is needed. This information is transmitted by the [end of data message](ble-gatt-messages.html#end-of-data-message). All values are transferred in [little-endian][endianess] byte sequence.

After de-compacting every value must be interpreted as the most significant part of an 16 bit wide signed integer. To get the real acceleration value from this intermediate value multiply it by one of the following factors.

| Scale / Resolution | 8 bit | 10 bit | 12 bit |
|-|-|-|-|
|  2G |  $\frac{16}{256*1000}$ |  $\frac{4}{64*1000}$ |  $\frac{1}{16*1000}$ |
|  4G |  $\frac{32}{256*1000}$ |  $\frac{8}{64*1000}$ |  $\frac{2}{16*1000}$ |
|  8G |  $\frac{64}{256*1000}$ | $\frac{16}{64*1000}$ |  $\frac{4}{16*1000}$ |
| 16G | $\frac{192}{256*1000}$ | $\frac{48}{64*1000}$ | $\frac{12}{16*1000}$ |

### 12 bit data format ###

In 12 bit resolution mode two values are transmitted inside 3 bytes. See following figure.

### 10 bit data format ###

In 10 bit resolution mode four values are transmitted inside 5 bytes. See following figure.

![](./gfx/org/bitpack10.png)

### 8 bit data format ###

In 8 bit resolution mode every value is transmitted seperatly. See following figure.

![](./gfx/org/bitpack8.png)

## Flash statistic ##

Flash usage is an important information. It is especially useful for determining when it is needed to download logged acceleration data from the sensor. This message is implemented as a proprietary message. To request flash usage statistic use the following control message `0xFA 0xFA 0x0D`. As every control message it must be padded to 11 bytes.

The sensor responds to this control message using a flash statistic response. It has the following structure:

| Byte | Value | Description |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | `0xFB` | Header |
| 2 | `0x0D` | Header |
| 3 | SS | Status byte regarding this operation. |
| 4 | LS | Status regarding the background logging operation. |
| 5 | start | Ringbuffer start index. |
| 6 | end | Ringbuffer end index. |
| 8 | size | Ringbuffer size. |
| 9-10 | valid records | The number of valid records. |
| 10-11 | dirty records | The number of deleted ("dirty") records. |
| 12-13 | words reserved | The number of words reserved. |
| 14-15 | words used | The number of words written to flash, including those reserved for future writes. |
| 16-17 | largest continious | The largest number of free contiguous words in the file system. |
| 18-19 | freeable words | The largest number of words that can be reclaimed by garbage collection. |

Multi byte values are transmitted in [little-endian][endianess] byte sequence.
